# UdacityDLp2_dog_classification
This project trains a convolutional neural network model to classify dog pictures. The data can be downloaded [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip). The step-by-step explanations of how to do image pre-processing, model definition, training and testing were described in detail in the Jupyter notebook.
